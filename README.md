# Prog-DA-Assignment

## Project Plan
- I will examine the functions of the Jupyter Notebook, outlining the advantages and disadvantages for some of the research Material I used. 
- I will then examine six (6) distribution function.
- I will plot each and try to figure out how they differ.
- I will then examine and discuss the seed function. 


- All of this with will be done in the Jupyter Notebook in a code cell or in a markdown cell. This is to make it easier for the reader to follow.  
- I will reference my work at the start of each question segment.
